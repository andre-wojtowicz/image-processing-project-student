# Mini-GIMP template project for Image processing course

This program is a student template of a project for **Image processing** course. During 15 laboratories the students have to program a mini-GIMP application.

The code is written in C++ which uses [Qt](https://www.qt.io) library; tested 5.1.1 version, should compile and run on Windows (MinGW or MSVC), Linux and MacOS. The code may be completed in Qt Creator or Visual Studio. The program works with all [Netpbm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_anymap) files as well as JPEG, PNG, etc.

The program has the following image processing procedures to be completed:

1. negative (already done as an example),
2. grayscale conversion,
3. correction (brightness, contrast and gamma),
4. histogram (construction, stretching and equalizing),
5. convolution (with custom filter),
6. blurring (uniform and Gaussian),
7. binarization (manual, gradient, iterative bimodal, Otsu and Niblack),
8. noise reduction (median and bilateral),
9. morphology (structural elements, dilation, erosion, opening and closing),
10. edge detection (Roberts, Prewitt, Sobel, Laplacian with zero-crossing and Canny),
11. procedural textures (height map, normal mapping, horizon mapping and Perlin noise),
12. lines and rectangles detection (Hough),
13. corners detection (Harris),
14. segmentation (watershed).

**The completed version of the project is stored on the private repository**. It is stored for lecturer's as a helpfull tool to assess students' solutions. If you need it, please send me an e-mail.

# Documentation

The project consists of 3 folders:
* **images** - contains images saved in `pnm` format,
* **res** - here are icons for the program,
* **src** - main sources.
 
In sources you can find two modules:
* **core** - files concering loading and saving images and transofmations,
* **gui** - everything related to a graphic user interface.
 
Writing solutions means completing the `.cpp` files in a directory `src/core/transformations/` and a file `src/core/histogram.cpp`. 

A hint that something needs to be implement is:

```cpp
qDebug() << Q_FUNC_INFO << "Not implemented yet!";
```

## Multi-core compilation

To make compilation procedure faster, you have to set the number of created parallel `make` instances. In Qt project settings `Projects > Build Settings > Build Steps > Make arguments` type for example `-j 8`.

## Debugging

If you like debugging by printing values of variables you just need to use `qDebug()` in the following way:

```cpp
qDebug() << "width =" << image->width();
```

## PNM class

Main class to handle an image is **PNM** which inherits [QImage](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtgui/qimage.html). Main methods are:
 * **pixel(...)** - getting a value of a given pixel of an image,
 * **setPixel(...)** - saving in the image given value of a pixel,
 * **format()** - getting a format of the image.
 
We are interested only in three formats of images:
 * **QImage::Format_Mono** - black and white,
 * **QImage::Format_Indexed8** - grayscale,
 * **QImage::Format_RGB32** - 3-channels color.
 
To get a value of a pixel from a desired channel some functions from [QColor](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtgui/qcolor.html) will be helpful:
 * **qRed(...)**,
 * **qGreen(...)**,
 * **qBlue(...)**,
 * **qGray(...)**.
 
An example is in `src/core/transformations/negative_image.cpp`

## Automatic loading of an image

If you setup a working directory on a folder `images` then when you run the program you should see on the screen `lenna_512x512.pnm`.

More information you will find at the top of `src/gui/mainwindow.h`.

During compilation you might find useful automatic launching of a transformation.
 
## Signals

Some of next transformations may perform a bit longer so it will be OK to display some auxiliary messages. You may achieve it by so-called signals:
 * **message(QString)**,
 * **progress(int)**.
 
Example:
```cpp
emit message("Edge detection...");
```

or

```cpp
emit progress(100*x/double(image->width()));
```

## Mixing transformations

Some of transformations need using others. In transformations you must use `transform()` method, i.e.:

```cpp
PNM* grayImage = ConversionGrayscale(image).transform();
```

Most of the transformations use parameters (constants, sigmas, regions etc.). It's done by methods:
 * **setParameter(...)**,
 * **getParameter(...)**.
 
An exemplar use is in a file `src/core/tools.cpp` or `src/core/transformations/edge_canny.cpp`

In order to display messages or progress of used transformation you must put in its construction an instance of `ImageViewer`, i.e.:

```cpp
emit message("Blurring...");

BlurGaussian blurTrans(grayImage, getSupervisor());
blurTrans.setParameter("size",  3);
blurTrans.setParameter("sigma", 1.6);

PNM* blurredImage = blurTrans.transform();
```

Please remember to delete redundant variables before you return a result, i.e.:

```cpp
delete grayImage;

return newImage;
```

## Possible performance increase

 * resign from `src/core/matrix.h` and work directly on arrays,
 * avoid `QImage::pixel(...)` and `QImage::setPixel(...)` and work directly on arrays given by `QImage::bits()`


# Programming in Visual Studio 2012 with Image Watch extenstion

There is [Visual Studio Add-in](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/vsaddin/) for Qt5 so you don't have to use Qt Creator and what's more, debugging is far easier and faster.

Microsoft released [Image Watch](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e682d542-7ef3-402c-b857-bbfba714f78d) extension which allows to display an image during debugging.

1. import the project (`QT5 > Open Qt Project File (.pro)...`),
1. open `pnm.h` file and uncomment lines 11-13,
1. add to your project a path to a directory with private Qt headers (in _Solution Explorer_ `Properties > Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General > Additional Include Directories`):
 * this can be for example `C:\software\qt\5.1.1\msvc2012\include\QtGui\5.1.1`. 
1. to your directory `Documents\Visual Studio 2012\Visualizers` copy `src\core\pnm.natvis`,
1. install **Image Watch** extension (`Tools > Extensions and Updates...` and in _Online_ search _Image Watch_).

Effects you can check on the negative operation. During debugging you have to display _Image Watch_ window (`View > Other Windows > Image Watch`) and when the debugger reaches breakpoints you can watch any PNM-type variable (with the exception of binary images! but you can handle this by conversion to a grayscale). When you click on a variable you must also tick _4-Channel Ignore Alpha_.
